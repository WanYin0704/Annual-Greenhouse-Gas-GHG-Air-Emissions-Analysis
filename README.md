# Annual-Greenhouse-Gas-GHG-Air-Emissions-Analysis

Welcome to the Annual Greenhouse Gas GHG Air Emissions Analysis Project! In light of the pressing issues raised by climate change, it is more important than ever to comprehend and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With regard to GHG emissions, this project seeks to explore the complex dynamics involved, as well as their sources and effects on the environment, economy, and society.

## Dataset 
Our project endeavors to analyze datasets sourced from the [International Monetary Fund's Climate Change Dashboard](https://climatedata.imf.org/). 
- Dataset: [**Annual Greenhouse Gas GHG Air Emissions**](https://climatedata.imf.org/datasets/c8579761f19740dfbe4418b205654ddf/explore)

## Analysis and Visualization
**Understanding trends, locating the main sources of GHG emissions, and examining temporal and spatial patterns** will be the main focuses of our analysis. We will also guarantee the integrity of the dataset and its usefulness for analysis through thorough **data cleaning, preparation, and wrangling**. To extract significant insights, we will then execute **group operations and data aggregation**. In term of **machine learning methods** application , we came out with seven different research questions to estimate greenhouse gas emissions, delving into the intricacies of these emissions. Our research questions are summarized as follows:

1. Can machine learning models accurately predict a country's greenhouse gas emissions for the year 2022 based on historical data from 2013 to 2021?
2. How well can machine learning models differentiate between normal emission patterns and anomalies?
3. How well does the model predict annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the year 2022 based on historical data from the year 2013?
4. How well can machine learning models differentiate between various countries (Country column) based on their greenhouse gas emissions, considering different gas types and industries (Gas_Type and Industry columns)?
5. Which features have the most significant impact on predicting greenhouse gas emissions in a country?
6. Can we classify countries into different groups or clusters and observe patterns in their greenhouse gas emissions over the years, using clustering algorithms?
7. Can machine learning classify emissions patterns for different gas types?

By employing a comprehensive methodology that included exploratory data analysis, statistical approaches, and sophisticated machine learning models, our project produced valuable insights regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We have discovered important information via in-depth investigation and analysis that advances our knowledge of the dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions and possible mitigation tactics.
